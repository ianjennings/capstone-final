                    <h3>Foreword</h3>

                    <p>The following is a case study comparing the popular charts of a few online music services. My name is <a href="twitter.com/sw1tch">Ian</a>, and I conducted this study as part of the <a href="http://comminfo.rutgers.edu/component/cat,DCIM+Capstone/option,com_newmultimedia/tagvocab%5B%5D,DCIM+Capstone/view,catlist/">Capstone</a> course for the <a href="http://comminfo.rutgers.edu/digital-communication-information-and-media-minor/program-information.html">Digital Communications and Information Media</a> minor at <a href="http://www.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University</a>.</p>

                    <p>This web page is a visual aid and extended explanation of the concepts discussed in the final apper. You can read the paper in it's entirety <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Abstract</h3>

                    <p>Prior to the explosion of digital distribution, record companies controlled the mass production and distribution of music through physical mediums, such as compact discs, vinyl records, and cassette tapes. Music popularity was determined simply by in-store sales. Power shifted from the record companies to the consumer with the development of new mediums, such as MP3s. In addition, gauging popularity became more difficult due to the diverse nature of music distribution. This paper examines the power shift from producer to consumer in the music industry and the radical shift in how we define popular music. </p>

                    <h3>Case Study</h3>

                    <p>I compare the popular charts of three music services. Each service represents a different definition of popular: Hype Machine offers metrics based on blog posts and user favorites, Billboard attempts to aggregate many services with different weights, and Sirius XMU does not explicitly state how they determine their chart.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="solid box" id="popularity">

                    <h3>Popularity Charts</h3>

                    <h4>Hype Machine</h4> 

                    <p>The first music service is the Hype Machine, which publishes a yearly zeitgeist of the most blogged tracks on the service. In order for a blog post to be recorded by the Hype Machine, it must be in its list of tracked blogs.  The Hype Machine aggregates posts from 848 blogs (“About the hype”) on the Internet. For every blog post, the Hype Machine records the track title and artist.</p>

                    <p>In the yearly zeitgeist the Hype Machine lists the top 50 tracks that had the largest number of blog posts made about them that year.</p>

                    <h4>Billboard Year-End Hot 100 Singles</h4>

                    <p>Billboard is a magazine and online website dedicated to being the industry’s premier news source (“About us”). Although Billboard updates its charts every day, every year it publishes a top 100 chart displaying the most popular tracks appearing in its system. The “Hot” charts are a unique Billboard chart because it combines digital and physical airplay and sales.</p>

                    <blockquote> 

                        <p>“Sales: Data for Billboard's sales charts, which include all album charts, are compiled by Nielsen SoundScan from a universe of retailers that represents more than 90% of the U.S. music retail market.”</p>

                        <p>The sample includes not only music stores and the music departments at electronics and department stores, but also direct-to-consumer transactions and Internet sales (both physical albums via Internet, and ones bought via digital downloads). A limited array of verifiable sales from concert venues is also tabulated. All sales charts use the entire Nielsen SoundScan panel.</p>

                        <p>The Nielsen SoundScan system utilizes that same point-of-sale that music merchants use to track their inventory, so an itemized receipt from one's last visit to a music retailer essentially doubles as a ballot cast for our charts.</p>

                        <p>Airplay: Billboard's radio charts are compiled using information tracked by Nielsen BDS, which electronically monitors radio stations in more than 140 markets across the United States. The BDS system looks for an audio fingerprint, i.e. a characteristic that differentiates a track from all of the other ones that it tracks...</p>

                        <p>…The audience charts cross-reference BDS data with listener information compiled by the Arbitron ratings system to determine the approximate number of audience impressions made for each plays. Thus, a song that plays at 4 a.m. does not count as much as one played at 4 p.m., and a station with a large audience will influence the chart more than either a station in a smaller market or one with a specialized format that attracts less audience.”<p>

                    </blockquote>

                    <h4>Sirius XMU Top 41 Chart</h4>

                        <p>Sirius XMU is one of more than 300 channels on Sirius XM. The channel is described as North America’s Indie Rock station. Listeners can expect to hear artists such as Animal Collective, Pavement, Arcade Fire, Radiohead, Grizzly Bear, Modest Mouse, Vampire Weekend, Beach House, Shins, and the Flaming Lips on the channel.</p>

                        <p>Sirius XMU often has radio shows hosted by bloggers such as Hipster Runoff, My Old Kentucky Blog, Brooklyn Vegan, Gorilla vs Bear, and Aquarium Drunkard. The bloggers have two hours set to play tracks of their choice.</p>

                        <p>Every year the channel produces a program where a DJ works through the top 41 tracks of the year in reverse order. The process and order in which tracks are placed in the top 41 chart is not disclosed.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="solid box" id="process">

                    <h3>Process</h3>

                    <p>First, I compared every track on the Hype Machine listing with the other annual lists for the year 2011. If a track existed both on the Hype Machine and in another list, I recorded the track artist and name. I also recorded what chart the track appeared in and in what position.</p>

                    <p>I then grabbed the Hype Machine page for every track that had a match. I also recorded the number of blogposts that Hype Machine has recorded about that track. It is important to note that I did not filter a date range, so blogposts written after the years end will appear in this count. However, it is unlikely that a track will get significant attention in the years after it appeared on a popular chart.</p>

                    <p>Next, I recorded the number of track favorites. On the Hype Machine website and mobile apps the listener can click on a heart icon to favorite the track. Clicking favorite on a track saves the track to the user’s profile and pushes it further up the popular page. A heart icon implies that the user “likes” the track, but it can also be used as a tool to save the track for later listening or simply to increase the visibility of the track on the popular page. Users do not need to listen to a track to favorite it. Every user can only favorite a track once, so we can assume that the number is close to a number of real people taking a favorable action toward the track.</p>

                    <p>The graphic shows normalized rankings of popularity for the Sirius XMU and Billboard charts. I wanted to show that a track with a lower ranking was more popular so the values were inverted by subtracting them from 100, the maximum value that comes from the number of listings on Billboard. It is also important to note that there is a 41/100 chance that a track will appear on Sirius XMU as compared to Billboard because of the length difference between charts.</p>
                    
                    <p>I repeated this process for years 2010 and 2009, combined the results into one table, and sorted the chart by number of Hype Machine blog posts.</p>

                    <p>Pumped Up Kicks by Foster The People is interesting. Despite the low number of blogs that posted about this tracks on Hype Machine (55), it had the second largest number of favorites (23,000) in 2011 and ranked the highest on Billboard for that year (#13).</p>

                    <p>In a radio interview with “themusicpimp,” an employee of Hype Machine, Dev Sherlock, mentions Foster the People and explains...</p>

                    <blockquote><p>“some blogs caught on to them and started posting them, but then when people came to the site and heard the song, they all started favoriting it and it went up the popular chart. [It’s] what the users really liked. So it was the fans that made Foster the People big... Really it was the listeners that said, hey, I really like this.”</p>

                    <p>In order for a track to appear on the Hype Machine, a blog must post about it once. There was little writing about the track, but once people heard the track on Hype Machine, they favorited it.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“it sums up a genre that came to prominence in the summer, and is a nice pop slanted example of it, regardless of the stigma attached to the ‘hazepop’ genre.”</p>

                    <p>The catchy chorus and beat as described by bloggers suggest why the track was so popular despite having few blogposts. There was not much hype around the artist or album, but the track proved to be strong. This is also reason for its appearance on the Billboard charts. Interestingly, the track’s lyrics are a first person account of the Columbine shootings.</p>

                    <h4>Bruno Mars - Just The Way You Are</h4>

                    <p>This Bruno Mars track was only posted by 6 blogs on the Hype Machine and only had 1,400 favorites by users in 2010. However it ranked #15 on Billboard charts. This track was described as even simpler than Foster the People.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“The mainstream needs to make room for a new star. The boy Bruno has the Pop ear of a Dr. Pepper commercial and the vocal charm to match.”</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“It’s how pop music is supposed to be done. The formula for success on ”Just The Way You Are” is simple: crisp and funky beat, delicate piano line, and Bruno’s pipes dropping some saccharine loving on his girl. That’s it! Clean, simple, and beautiful. That’s the way of Bruno Mars.“</p>

                    </blockquote>

                    <p>The large difference between the number of bloggers writing about the track, the number of people who favorited the track on the Hype Machine, and the position on Billboard signifies the difference in audience and operation of the two services. Hype Machine users are looking to discover a new kind of music that is not on the radio while blog posts mention that “Just The Way You Are” has had plenty of airtime on FM.</p>

                    <p>Midnight City had a grand 242 blog posts made about it as well as an equally impressive 36,000 favorites. It was ranked #1 on the Sirius XMU chart, but did not appear in the Billboard chart.</p>

                    <blockquote>

                        <p>“Backed by ten years in the music industry and five full length albums, M83 (aka Anthony Gonzales) is gearing up for what promises to be a blockbuster-scale release next October 18th. This is the date announced for the indie dream pop act’s new album Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming.</p>
                        <p>The band-turned-solo-act’s epic new double album (22 tracks!) is already making a lot of noise and so is the lead single “Midnight City”, released mid-August as a free download and instantly crowned “Best New Track” by Pitchfork. Starting with grinding metallic synthesizers, “Midnight City” slowly adds layers of electronic sounds and live percussion to finally swirl into a supernatural avalanche that pumps you full of adrenaline.”</p>

M83 are frontrunners in the game of great electronic music, and this newest track of theirs is no exception.”</p>

                    </blockquote>

                    <p>This single track was released free to stream on soundcloud in order to promote M83’s the then upcoming record in October 2011. Many blogs point out that M83 has more than 10 years of experience, including 5 previous albums. This indicates the bad already has a loyal fan base who is familiar to the artist.</p>

                    <p>In addition, blogs note that this track signifies an iteration in the sound of M83. The single track acts as a teaser to the media, providing a taste of what the future double sized record holds.</p>

                    <p>The combined existing fan-base, iteration on a current sound, and taste of something much larger coming out in the near future creates a huge amount of press for this track. In fact, many blog posts mention that they blog about the track just because so many other bloggers have as well.</p>

                    <h3>Observations</h3>

                    <p>The first observation was that a large number of blog posts do not indicate that people will actually favorite the music on the Hype Machine. This means the amount of people talking about music on blogs is not an indication of the track’s popularity on the Hype Machine.</p>

                    <p>The tracks that overlap between Billboard and the Hype Machine often have very few blog posts and lie on the tail end of the graph. This means that the Hype Machine has more in common with Sirius XMU than Billboard; there are less Billboard songs and they appear on the lower end of the popularity scale.</p>

                    <p>Comparing data over the years shows that the Hype Machine audience was radically different before 2010. In 2009, only two tracks overlap with Sirius XMU tracks from the same year and there is virtually no overlap with the Billboard charts.</p>

                    <p>The largest discovery is that virtually no tracks overlap between all three services. This means that all of the services operate individually, with different audiences and different reasons for determining if something is popular.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                    <p>Despite all the manners in which we can discover music, it is impossible to pinpoint one service that determines popularity.</p>

                    <p>The answer may be to aggregate the aggregates. A service called Ultimate Chart attempts to make an aggregate of popularity charts, pulling in data from more than 100 services. However, once a competitor to this service exists it would once again be difficult to determine true popularity.</p>

                    <p>Through the mass distribution of music and countless services being used to discover and rank music being built everyday there are two clear trends.</p>

                    <p>The first is that the record industry no longer has control over how music is distributed. The consumer has won and music will be shared regardless of what measures the record industry uses to protect itself. This is a clear pattern in the history of music media.</p>

                    <p>The second is that the concept of popularity has gotten more complex than ever. There are simply too many metrics to analyze. What is popular to you is not the same as what is popular to me. What is popular on blogs is not the same as what is popular on the radio. The seemingly infinite number of distribution channels has created distributed popularity.</p>
